  abstract={Deep-learning-based brain age estimation using magnetic resonance imaging data has been proposed to identify abnormalities in brain development and the risk of adverse developmental outcomes in the fetal brain. Although saliency and attention activation maps have been used to understand the contribution of different brain regions in determining brain age, there has been no attempt to explain the influence of shape-related cortical structural features on the variance of predicted fetal brain age. We examined the association between the predicted brain age difference (PAD: predicted brain age–chronological age) from our convolution neural networks-based model and global and regional cortical structural measures, such as cortical volume, surface area, curvature, gyrification index, and folding depth, using regression analysis. Our results showed that global brain volume and surface area were positively correlated with PAD. Additionally, higher cortical surface curvature and folding depth led to a significant increase in PAD in specific regions, including the perisylvian areas, where dramatic agerelated changes in folding structures were observed in the late second trimester. Furthermore, PAD decreased with disorganized sulcal area patterns, suggesting that the interrelated arrangement and areal patterning of the sulcal folds also significantly affected the prediction of fetal brain age. These results allow us to better understand the variance in deep learning-based fetal brain age and provide insight into the mechanism of the fetal brain age prediction model.},

  abstract={In many real-world scenarios, including the blood smear domain, it is difficult for detection networks to achieve good performance because image annotation is usually time consuming and expensive. To address this issue, similarity-based distillation (SD) methods, considered the soft version of contrastive learning, are applied to learn a better visual representation without requiring any supervision of the downstream task. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we treat standard SD methods as the maximization of common 1-hop neighboring key points between two queries in an attributed graph, where nodes represent query and key data points. However, such first-order graph heuristic methods that calculate the likelihood of an unseen link between target nodes by using up to 1-hop neighborhoods are normally limited by insufficient representation power and even lack of generalization ability.},

  abstract={Machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in diagnostic tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), revealing an altered brain connectivity. However, little is known about whether an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain network is related to the severity of ASD symptoms in a large-scale cohort. We propose a graph convolution neural network-based framework that can generate sparse hierarchical graph representations for functional brain connectivity. Instead of assigning initial features for each node, we utilized a feature extractor to derive node features and the extracted representations can be fed to a hierarchical graph self-attention framework to effectively represent the entire graph. By incorporating connectivity embeddings in the feature extractor, we propose adjacency embedding networks to characterize the heterogeneous representations of the brain connectivity. Our proposed model variants outperform the benchmarking model with different configurations of adjacency embedding networks and types of functional connectivity matrices. Using this approach with the best configuration (SHEN atlas for node definition, Tikhonov correlation for connectivity estimation, and identity-adjacency embedding), we were able to predict individual ASD severity levels with a meaningful accuracy: the mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation between predicted and observed ASD severity scores resulted in 0.96, and r = 0.61 (P < 0.0001), respectively. To obtain a better understanding on how to generate better representations, we investigate the relationships between the extracted feature embeddings and the graph theory-based nodal measurements using canonical correlation analysis. Finally, we visualized the model to identify the most contributive functional connections for predicting ASD severity scores.}
