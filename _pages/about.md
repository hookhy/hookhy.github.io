I am a Research Fellow at the Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging Developmental Science Center (FNNDSC) at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. I obtained my PhD in Electronic Engineering from **Hanyang University, South Korea**, in August 2024. My research primarily have focused on **graph neural networks** for analyzing various graph-structured data based on multimodal brain imaging. 
At my Postdoc. career in FNNDSC, I've focused on analyzing abnormal cortical sulcal patterns in congenital heart disease using structural MRI-based surface models. Extending this work, I currently aims to develop deep normative modeling of sulcal pattern graphs through unsupervised learning to apply to various disorders.
