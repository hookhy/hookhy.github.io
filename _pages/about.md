My research primarily have focused on **graph neural networks** for analyzing various graph-structured data based on multimodal brain imaging. 

At my Postdoc career in FNNDSC, I've focused on analyzing abnormal cortical sulcal patterns in congenital heart disease using structural MRI-based surface models. Extending this work, I currently aims to develop **deep normative modeling of sulcal pattern graphs** through unsupervised learning to apply to various disorders.
