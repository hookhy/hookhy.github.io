I obtained my PhD in Electronic Engineering from <strong>Hanyang University, South Korea</strong>, in August 2024.</p> <p>My research primarily have focused on <strong>graph neural networks</strong> for analyzing various graph-structured data based on multimodal brain imaging.</p> <p>At my Postdoc career in FNNDSC, I’ve focused on analyzing abnormal cortical sulcal patterns in congenital heart disease using structural MRI-based surface models. Extending this work, I currently aims to develop deep normative modeling of sulcal pattern graphs through unsupervised learning to apply to various disorders.</p> </body></html>
